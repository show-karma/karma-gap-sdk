Projects may address the diverse stack of collaborative protocols needed for successful multi-agent coordination such as: identity and attestation, on-chain delegation and roles, decentralized project management, fundraising and allocation, systems-aware strategic alignment processes, measurement and evaluation, and participatory governance and learning. These efforts may be theoretical and research-based or may be applied contexts of collaboration whose successful actualization could lead to protocolization of key activities and collaborative functions.  \n\nFor additional definitions and application details, please visit https://go.opencivics.co/wiki",
